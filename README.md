# React Quiz

A simple React quiz application that consists of 15 questions to test your knowledge of React.

## Features

- 15 React-related questions
- Provides instant feedback after completing the quiz
- Fake API to simulate data fetching for questions

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavlo1377/react-quiz.git
cd react-quiz
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies for both the front-end and the fake API:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Frontend

To start the React app, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the front-end application and you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 4. Run the Fake API

To start the fake API server that provides the quiz data, run:

```bash
npm run server
```

This will start the server for the fake API on `http://localhost:5000`.

## How It Works

- The app displays 15 React-related questions and lets users answer them.
- Once the quiz is completed, the user will get feedback on how many questions they answered correctly.
- The questions are fetched from a fake API that simulates real-time data fetching.
